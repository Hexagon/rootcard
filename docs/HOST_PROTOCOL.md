# rootcard: host protocol (HTTP binding)

This is the **recommended** HTTP binding of the host rules in [spec/SPEC.md](../spec/SPEC.md) §13 and §17. It is not
required: a host may use another transport as long as it keeps the rules of the specification. Clients, the key tool and
`rootcard-host` implement this binding, so hosts that follow it work with them unchanged. Rule identifiers (`[HST-6]`)
refer to the specification.

---

## 1. General

- **Addresses.** A host is reached at one or more base URLs ([HST-18]): `https://` followed by a host name, an optional
  port and an optional path without a trailing slash, whose segments use only `A`–`Z`, `a`–`z`, `0`–`9`, `-`, `.`, `_`
  and `~` and are never `.` or `..` ([HST-22]; `https://id.example.com`, `https://example.com/rootcard`). Every
  path below is relative to the **API root** `<base URL>/v0` (§1.3): `GET /host` means `GET <base URL>/v0/host`. The
  `home.url` of an instance is the address the host had when it receipted it; a host that moves keeps answering
  `GET /host` at old addresses with its current ones. Plain `http://` is allowed only
  for loopback addresses during development.
- **Choosing a base URL.** A host on a domain of its own uses the domain (`https://id.example.com`). A host that shares
  a domain with an application SHOULD use a path of its own, preferably `/rootcard` (`https://example.com/rootcard`,
  endpoints at `https://example.com/rootcard/v0/…`), so that its endpoints cannot collide with the application's. A
  base URL never ends in a version segment ([HST-22]): the version is added after it (§1.3). Such a host SHOULD also
  have the server of its domain answer the host pointer `GET https://example.com/.well-known/rootcard` (§2, [HST-23]),
  so that users can type the bare domain.
- **Address binding.** The `url` in login and fetch messages ([LGN-4]) is the base URL the client sent the request to,
  without the API version segment, exactly as configured in the client (for a browser client served by the host,
  derived from `location`). The host compares it with its list of base URLs.
- **Encoding.** Request and response bodies are JSON (`Content-Type: application/json`, UTF-8). Clients SHOULD send
  canonical JSON; hosts parse strictly ([CJ-6]) and always verify over canonical bytes ([CJ-7]). Hosts send canonical
  JSON for every rootcard structure.
- **Body size.** A host rejects request bodies over 6 MiB with `413 too_large` before parsing, and applies the limits of
  spec §19 per structure.
- **Authentication.** The session endpoints of §4 take `Authorization: Bearer <token>` ([HST-10]). They never accept
  cookies, so that no rootcard endpoint acts on ambient credentials. An application that wants a cookie session for its
  own endpoints creates it from the login result on its own server, with its own CSRF protection; that session follows
  [HST-11] like any other.
- **CORS.** Every endpoint except `/peer/*` answers with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` and allows the `Authorization`
  and `Content-Type` request headers, so that `keytool.html` (served from `file://`, origin `null`) and application
  clients on other origins can reach the host. This is safe because no rootcard endpoint relies on cookies.
- **Retries.** Every `POST` and `PUT` is safe to retry ([HST-20]): resubmitting exactly what was already stored returns
  the original answer, including the original receipt. Clients retry on network errors and `5xx` with backoff.
- **Caching.** Responses that contain a vault, a session token, lock hints or a challenge carry `Cache-Control:
  no-store`.
- **Host-served clients** SHOULD be served with a strict Content Security Policy (no inline script, no third-party
  script), `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and HSTS, since they handle passwords (THREAT_MODEL.md T19).

### 1.1 Errors

Every error is a JSON object with the specification's error code (spec §20):

```
{ "error": "<code>", "message"?: "<English text for developers>", ... }
```

| Status | Codes | Extra members |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `bad_json`, `bad_field`, `unsupported_version`, `bad_base64`, `bad_base32`, `bad_key`, `bad_signature`, `bad_realm`, `bad_username`, `username_policy`, `bad_handle`, `account_mismatch`, `bad_kind`, `bad_seq`, `bad_prev`, `time_backwards`, `future_time`, `bad_time`, `wrong_signer`, `key_reuse`, `bad_receipt`, `bad_reason`, `no_instance`, `wrong_instance`, `bad_locks`, `kdf_params`, `wrong_account_key`, `bad_data_key`, `wrong_host`, `too_many_events` | – |
| 401 | `unauthorized`, `challenge_unknown`, `challenge_expired` | – |
| 403 | `realm_not_accepted` | `realms`: the realms the host serves |
| 404 | `unknown_account` | – |
| 409 | `stale_version` | `version` and `events` (see §1.2) |
| 409 | `fork` | `version` and `events` (see §1.2) |
| 409 | `handle_taken` | – |
| 409 | `ambiguous_handle` | `candidates`: `[ { account, handle } ]` with extended tags |
| 409 | `stale_rev`, `stale_locks` | `rev` and `gen` the host has |
| 409 | `not_home` | `home`: `{ key, url }` of the primary host |
| 410 | `account_retired` | `version` |
| 413 | `too_large` | – |
| 429 | `rate_limited` | `Retry-After` header |

### 1.2 Versions in responses

Wherever a response carries `version`, it is the host's newest version for the account ([VER-4]). A `stale_version` or
`fork` answer carries `events`: the host's events from the first `seq` the request did not share with the host (the end
of the shorter log, or the fork point), so the client can extend its log and retry, or show the fork ([KT-7]).

### 1.3 API version

The binding is versioned by the first path segment after the base URL, separately from the format version (spec §22).

- **`/v0`** is the binding of the 0.x releases. It is the only version until 1.0.0, and it may change between 0.x
  releases; every change is recorded in the changelogs.
- **`/v1`** will be the stable binding from 1.0.0. After that, a breaking change to an endpoint needs a new version
  segment (`/v2`), and a host keeps serving the older one for a transition period that it announces.
- A host answers a version it does not serve, or a path without a version, with `404 unknown_account` (`"message": "no
  such endpoint"`). A host MAY serve several versions side by side over the same storage.
- The version segment is **never part of a base URL**: `home.url` in the log, `url` in login, fetch and change messages,
  and the host's list of addresses ([HST-18]) stay the same when the binding changes. Nothing that is signed and stored
  depends on the API version.
- Peer request signatures (§5) cover the path relative to the base URL, **including** the version segment, so that a
  signed request for one version is not accepted by another.

## 2. Public endpoints

### `GET /host`

The host descriptor. Not signed; it is trusted as far as the TLS connection to the base URL, and only used to find keys
and addresses: every signature a client relies on is checked against keys in a verified log.
```
{ "v": 1,
  "key": "ed25519:<current host key>",
  "retired_keys"?: [ "ed25519:<earlier host key>", ... ],
  "urls": [ "<base URL>", ... ],                       the first is preferred
  "realms": [ { "realm": "global", "username_policy"?: { "min": 3, "max": 20, "first": "letter" } } ],
  "peers"?: [ "ed25519:<host key>", ... ] }
```
A client registering an identity uses `key` and the base URL it is talking to as the new instance's `home` ([CLT-1]).
The host is the home of an instance whose `home.key` is `key` or one of `retired_keys` ([HST-17]).

### `GET <origin>/.well-known/rootcard`

The **host pointer** ([HST-23], RFC 8615). Unlike every other endpoint it is at the root of an origin, outside every
base URL and without an API version, so the application serving the origin routes it (`rootcard_host::http::well_known`
builds the answer). Optional; served by the origin, not looked up by any host.
```
{ "v": 1, "base": "<base URL on this origin>", "api": [ "v0" ] }
```
`base` is one of the host's addresses on the same scheme, host and port; `api` lists the API versions it serves (1 to
16). It answers with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` (a plain `GET` needs no preflight), and `404` when no address is
on the origin. Clients resolve it only for an address the user typed without a path (`https://example.com`), with
`well_known_base`, do not follow redirects, read at most 4 096 bytes, and use the origin itself when there is no `200`
answer. The resolved base URL, never the origin, goes into `home.url` and signed messages. The key tool and
`keytool.html` resolve `--host`, `--from` and their host fields this way.

### `GET /id/lookup?realm=<realm>&handle=<handle>`

Resolves a handle ([HDL-3]) or an extended handle in a realm (`realm` may be omitted on a host that serves one realm).
Any host that knows the identity answers.
```
200 { "account", "handle", "version", "home": { "key", "url" }?, "retired": false }
```
`home` is absent for a log with no current instance. Errors: `bad_handle`, `unknown_account`, `ambiguous_handle`,
`realm_not_accepted`.

### `GET /id/{account}/log?from=<seq>`

The host's newest log, from `seq` `from` (default 0).
```
200 { "version", "events": [ ... ] }
```

### `GET /id/{account}/public`

The current public profile ([DAT-3]). `404 unknown_account` if the host has none.

### `POST /id/{account}/events`

Carries newer events to a host ([VER-5], [HST-14]). Anyone may call it.
```
{ "events": [ ... ], "vault"?: Vault }
```
`events[0].seq` is `0` (the complete log) or any `s ≥ 1` for which `events[0].prev` is the hash of the host's event `s − 1`; the host combines its
events `0 … s − 1` with the submitted ones, verifies the result ([LOG-12] with `now`) and adopts it if it is newer
([VER-2]). A client that does not know the host's log sends the complete log. `vault` is accepted only by the primary
host, only together with a `rotate_recovery` ([KT-5]), and is verified against the resulting log state ([VLT-3],
[VLT-4]); the events and the vault are adopted together or not at all.
```
200 { "version" }                    the host's version after the request
409 stale_version                    the host's log is newer, or events[0].prev does not match
```

### `POST /id/register`

Registration ([HST-3]).
```
{ "log": [ inception, pending instance ], "vault": Vault, "public"?: PublicProfile }
201 { "account", "handle", "version", "receipt": "<b64u receipt signature>" }
```
The receipt lets the client complete its copy of the instance event without fetching the log.

### `POST /id/{account}/instance`

A new instance on this host ([HST-5], [KT-3]); the host becomes the primary host.
```
{ "events"?: [ ... ], "instance": pending instance, "vault": Vault, "public"?: PublicProfile }
201 { "version", "receipt" }
409 stale_version                    rebuild on top of the returned events
```
`events` are prior events the host may lack, with the same rules as `POST /id/{account}/events`. After `201` the host
pushes the instance to its peers and to the previous primary host ([HST-15]).

---

## 3. Fetch, login and vault replacement (primary host only)

Every endpoint in this section answers `409 not_home` on a host that is not the primary host ([HST-9]).

### `GET /id/{account}/locks`

The lock hints ([FET-2]).
```
200 { "instance": "<b64u>", "locks": [ { "id", "label", "kdf": { "alg", "m", "t", "p", "salt" } }, ... ] }
```
Only password locks are listed.

### `POST /id/{account}/challenge`

```
{ "purpose": "fetch" | "login" | "change" }
200 { "nonce", "host", "realm", "version", "expires" }
```
The challenge ([CHL-1]) is bound to the account and the purpose and is valid once, for 60 s ([CHL-2]).

### `POST /id/{account}/fetch`

The vault after a lock proof ([FET-1]).
```
{ "lock": "<lock id or recovery>", "nonce", "url", "sig" }
200 { "vault": Vault }
```

### `PUT /id/{account}/vault`

A vault replacement without a session, authorized by a new grant: the new `locks.grant.gen` must be greater than the
stored one ([HST-12]). The key tool uses it to add a password ([KT-4]) and after a rotation ([KT-5]).
```
{ "vault": Vault }
200 { "rev" }
```
Errors: `unauthorized` if `locks.grant.gen` does not increase, `stale_rev`, and the codes of [VLT-3].

### `POST /id/{account}/login`

The login ([LGN-1] step 6).
```
{ "nonce", "version", "url", "lock": "<lock id or recovery>", "sig", "lock_sig" }
200 { "token": "<b64u>", "handle", "instance": "<b64u>", "idle_timeout": 86400 }
```
The answer carries the login result ([LGN-1] step 6). A host that issues its own session instead returns that session in
the same members.

---

## 4. Session endpoints (primary host only)

All take `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and answer `401 unauthorized` without a valid session ([HST-10], [HST-11]).

| Endpoint | Body | Answer | Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /session/logout` | – | `204` | HST-11 |
| `GET /session/vault` | – | `200 { "vault" }` | HST-10 |
| `PUT /session/vault` | `{ "vault" }` | `200 { "rev" }`; data updates only | VLT-3, VLT-4, HST-12 |
| `POST /session/password` | `{ "lock", "nonce", "url", "proof", "vault" }` | `200 { "rev" }` | CHG-1, CHG-2 |
| `PUT /session/public` | `{ "public" }` | `200 { "rev" }` | DAT-2, DAT-3 |
| `GET /session/export` | – | `200` the account file, `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="<username>-<tag>.rootcard.json"` | FIL-2 |

A session belongs to one instance: the host checks on every request that the instance is still current ([HST-11]), so
after a new instance or retirement every request with an old token answers `401 unauthorized`.

---

## 5. Peer endpoints

Peers are hosts that serve the same realm and have added each other's host keys ([HST-15]). Peer requests are signed:

```
Rootcard-Peer-Key:  ed25519:<sender host key>
Rootcard-Peer-Time: <Unix seconds>
Rootcard-Peer-Sig:  b64u(Ed25519.sign(sender host key, frame("rootcard/peer/v1",
                      { "method": "GET" | "POST", "path": "<path and query after the base URL>", "time": t,
                        "to": "ed25519:<receiver host key>", "body": "<b64u SHA-256 of the request body bytes>" })))
```
`path` includes the API version (`/v0/peer/push`, §1.3). The receiver accepts a peer request only if the key is one of
its peers, `|time − now| ≤ 60`, and the signature verifies strictly. Peer authentication only decides who may use the
peer endpoints and their rate limits: everything a peer sends is verified like data from anyone ([HST-14]).

### `GET /peer/changes?since=<cursor>`

```
200 { "cursor": "<opaque>", "changes": [ { "account", "version", "public_rev"? }, ... ] }
```
The identities whose log or public profile changed after `cursor` (an empty `since` lists everything). The caller
fetches what it lacks with `GET /id/{account}/log` and `GET /id/{account}/public`. Peers SHOULD poll every 30 s.

### `POST /peer/push`

```
{ "account", "events"?: [ ... ], "public"?: PublicProfile }
200 { "version" }
```
The same processing as `POST /id/{account}/events` and a profile update without a session: the profile is adopted if it
verifies ([DAT-2]) and is newer ([DAT-3]). Vaults are never pushed ([HST-13]).

---

## 6. Recommended rate limits

| Operation | Per network address | Per identity |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /id/register` | 3 per hour | – |
| `GET /id/lookup`, `/log`, `/public` | 120 per minute | – |
| `GET /id/{account}/locks` | 30 per hour | 30 per hour |
| `POST /id/{account}/challenge` | 10 per minute | 30 per hour |
| `POST /id/{account}/fetch` | 30 per hour | 10 per hour |
| `POST /id/{account}/login` | 10 per minute | 30 per hour |
| `POST /session/password` | 10 per hour | 10 per hour |
| `POST /id/{account}/events`, `/instance` | 30 per hour | 10 instances per day |
| Session endpoints | 120 per minute | 120 per minute |

Failed fetches are online password guesses (THREAT_MODEL.md T11); a host SHOULD count them separately and MAY add a
delay that grows with consecutive failures. Limits per identity let an attacker delay the owner (AR8); a host SHOULD
exempt clients that present a valid session.

---

## 7. Flows *(informative)*

The workflows from the user's and the server's point of view are in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §2.1. These are the requests.

**Registration** (application client, [CLT-1]):
```
GET  /host                                   → key, urls, realms
     build inception + pending instance (home = this host) + vault + empty profile; hand the recovery card to the user
POST /id/register                            → account, handle, version, receipt
```

**Login** ([LGN-1]):
```
GET  /id/lookup?realm=global&handle=Astra%233F9C → account, version, home (any host; then go to home.url)
GET  /id/{account}/log?from=<n>              → extend; POST /id/{account}/events if the client's log is newer
GET  /id/{account}/locks                     → lock hints               (skipped with a cached vault)
POST /id/{account}/challenge {fetch}         → sign the fetch message with the lock's auth key
POST /id/{account}/fetch                     → vault; unlock it
POST /id/{account}/challenge {login}         → sign the login message with the account key and the lock's auth key
POST /id/{account}/login                     → token
```

**Change password** (logged in, [CHG-1]):
```
     build the new lock for the slot and the new vault (rev + 1)
POST /id/{account}/challenge {change}        → sign the change proof with the old lock's auth key
POST /session/password                       → rev
```

**Download the identity** ([FIL-2]): `GET /session/export` → the account file.

**Name a host by its domain** ([HST-23]): the user types `https://example.com`; the client asks
`GET https://example.com/.well-known/rootcard`, gets `{ "base": "https://example.com/rootcard", … }`, and uses that base
URL from then on (`GET https://example.com/rootcard/v0/host`, and `home.url` at registration). Without a pointer it uses
`https://example.com` itself.

**Move to another host, or reset a forgotten password** (key tool, [KT-3], [KT-8]):
```
GET  /id/{account}/log at every reachable host, and read account files → the newest version
POST /id/{account}/challenge {fetch} and /fetch with the recovery key at the old primary host (or use the account file)
GET  /host at the new host (the same host for a reset)
POST /id/{account}/instance at the new host   → receipt; the new host pushes to the old one, which answers not_home
```

---

## 8. Running a host *(informative)*

`rootcard-host` implements these endpoints as framework-independent handlers over two storage traits;
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md describes them. Whatever the implementation, a production host needs:

- **Shared storage** for all its servers with compare-and-swap updates ([HST-19]): per identity the events, the log
  state, the vault and the profile; a unique index on `(realm, lower-case username, tag)`; challenges with a 60 s expiry
  and an atomic take; sessions (or the host's own session mechanism) keyed by account and instance.
- **The host key** loaded from the host's secret store, plus retired keys ([HST-17]). Only receipts and peer requests
  use it, so it can live in a signing service.
- **A synchronized clock** ([HST-21]) and the rate limits of §6, keyed by network address and by account.
- **No password handling at all.** Hosts never run Argon2id; a request costs a few signature checks.
